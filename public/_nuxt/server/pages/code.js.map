We were told to create a god game and had full creative control of how it looked, worked and felt. After a few initial pitch ideas, we went with Matthew's ideas of a dystopian mining game where the objective was to discover caves and dig to the bottom, where an artifact laid, waiting for the characters. The targeted audience was everyone, although there were some darker themes to be explored in the game later on, most of it was not implemented so it was suitable for all ages demographics. We went with mobile development first, and have also created a PC version that works equally well, although the mobile version utilized more touch feedback and we wanted to cater specifically for phones first, so the experiences are slightly different.</h4> <h4 data-v-65fdde67>The story was further developed by Michael, Matt and Me. Bore began in a wasteland, a toxic desert from where our main characters escape to down below. As the earth crumbled, so did its civilizations. As their knowledge of technology dimmed, our settlers began once again to worship beings from ancient myths, crediting many useful tools to their creation. Driven by a desire to survive and one day perhaps to return to the surface, the inhabitants of BORE burrow deeper and deeper beneath the earth's surface, discovering caves, mysteries and a blood stained truth that would change their lives forever.</h4> <h4 data-v-65fdde67>Matthew and I had distinctly different styles and it wasn't until almost the end of the project where we understood that our differences did not create a cohesive game. We had the same ideas and concepts in mind, but our executions were always different. As he worked on the environmental art that would give a distinct feeling to our game, we decided to attempt to marry my style to his instead of the other way around. Discovering a difference in execution was eye-opening to me, and I believe being versatile in styles was a positive thing that helped make BORE the visual delight that it became.</h4> <h4 data-v-65fdde67> INSERT PICTURES HERE </h4> <div class=\\\"project-desc col-12 offset-md-2 col-md-8 mt-5\\\" data-v-65fdde67><h2 style=\\\"text-align:center;\\\" data-v-65fdde67>EXECUTION</h2></div> <h4 data-v-65fdde67> DESIGN AND UI, AND WHY THE TWO ARE DIFFERENT </h4></div></div> <div class=\\\"container-fluid\\\" data-v-65fdde67><section class=\\\"row\\\" data-v-65fdde67><div class=\\\"project-desc col-md-3 offset-md-1 mt-5\\\" style=\\\"text-align:right; border:#696c65 1px solid;\\\" data-v-65fdde67><h2 data-v-65fdde67> FIRST STEP OF GODS </h2> <h4 data-v-65fdde67> First Step of Gods was a upper level game created by students 2 semesters ahead of me.
