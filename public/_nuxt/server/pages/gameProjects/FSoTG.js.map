The producer and I met during a request for additional artists on her game jam project, and I volunteered to help her project out later in the semester. We worked together with the designers to create a completely new game in look and feel.</h4> <h4 data-v-33af20a8>BORE begins with the escape of our main characters from the toxic wasteland above ground to the unknown depths below. As Earth's atmosphere crumbled, so did its civilizations. Knowledge of technology dimmed, people began  to worship beings from ancient myths, and many credited useful tools to their mythical creations. Driven by a desire to survive and one day perhaps to return to the surface, the inhabitants of BORE burrow deeper and deeper beneath the earth's surface, discovering caves, mysteries, and the truth of their humanity.</h4> <img\"+(_vm._ssrAttr(\"src\",require(\"assets/img/GODS/title.png\")))+\" style=\\\"width:65vw;\\\" data-v-33af20a8> <h2 data-v-33af20a8> RESPONSIBILITIES </h2> <h4 data-v-33af20a8> I worked on the UI of the game and created the artwork for it. I also worked on the character art. </h4> <h4 data-v-33af20a8>Matthew and I had distinctly different styles and it wasn't until almost the end of the project where we understood that our differences did not create a cohesive game. We had the same ideas and concepts in mind, but our executions were always different. As he worked on the environmental art that would give a distinct feeling to our game, we decided to attempt to marry my style to his instead of the other way around. Discovering a difference in execution was eye-opening to me, and I believe being versatile in styles was a positive thing that helped make BORE the visual delight that it became.</h4> <h4 data-v-33af20a8>A picture is worth a thousand words so I'll just show you the rest of my work.</h4></div> <div class=\\\"figures\\\" data-v-33af20a8><img\"+(_vm._ssrAttr(\"src\",require(\"assets/img/GODS/screens.PNG\")))+\" data-v-33af20a8> <h4 data-v-33af20a8>The first version of UI.
