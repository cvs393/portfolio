          <h4>BORE was the result of a semester long project at the University of Abertay. We were told to create a god game and had full creative control of how it looked, worked and felt. After a few initial pitch ideas, we went with Matthew's ideas of a dystopian mining game, where the objective was to discover caves and dig to the bottom. The targeted audience was Everyone, although there were some darker themes to be explored in the game later on, most of it was not implemented so it was suitable for all ages &amp; demographics. We went with mobile development first, and have also created a PC version.The mobile version utilized more touch feedback and we wanted to cater specifically for phones first, so the experiences are slightly different.</h4>
          <h4>BORE begins with the escape of our main characters from the toxic wasteland above ground to the unknown depths below. As Earth's atmosphere crumbled, so did its civilizations. Knowledge of technology dimmed, people began  to worship beings from ancient myths, and many credited useful tools to their mythical creations. Driven by a desire to survive and one day perhaps to return to the surface, the inhabitants of BORE burrow deeper and deeper beneath the earth's surface, discovering caves, mysteries, and the truth of their humanity.</h4>
          <h4>Michael, Matt and I worked on furthering the lore of the game and adding dialogue to our main characters, which helped bring the world of BORE to life.</h4>

          <h4> DESIGN AND UI, AND WHY THE TWO ARE DIFFERENT </h4>
          <h4>Matthew and I had distinctly different styles and it wasn't until almost the end of the project where we understood that our differences did not create a cohesive game. We had the same ideas and concepts in mind, but our executions were always different. As he worked on the environmental art that would give a distinct feeling to our game, we decided to attempt to marry my style to his instead of the other way around. Discovering a difference in execution was eye-opening to me, and I believe being versatile in styles was a positive thing that helped make BORE the visual delight that it became.</h4>
